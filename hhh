(Using Google translate, sorry )

So the first thing you should do is make sure that you can read Simplified Chinese or you can use Google Translate's "Translate Entire Page" feature (just fill in the URL in Google Translate, then click "Translate" and set it to "From [Chinese Simplified] To [your language]")

These URL are about the Qihoo 360 on Wikipedia (Please read it first and do not change Language, you can only read the Chinese version to get the most information):
https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/奇虎360

https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/360安全卫士    (They software for Chinese)

So, start our topic:

On 2018/06/22 (UTC+8), I watched LTT's video. In these videos, I watched a video of Reviews Bitdefender.

I thought at the time that Linus might not know that China has a more powerful (junk) anti-virus software than this, not only free of charge, and it will try to install all of their softwares on your system, and remind you of some good sites has risky.

It betttttttttttttttttttttttttttttter (juuuuuuuuunk) than Bitdefender. It's true.

But, I just say 360 anti-virus software in China is junk, their "International Edition" is really better! No AD, no any bundled software, no anythings! It just a anti-virus!

Their English version of website: https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/

But it isn't end! If you can read Chinese (@Dennis), you should be using a bit time of "Chinse Edition".
